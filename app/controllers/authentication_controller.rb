# This controller deals with the concept of identities which are provided/verified
# by either a documentcloud account or third party service
# such as Twiter, Facebook, or Google Account
#
# It supports logging in via either the normal documentcloud login methods
# or by using an iframe embedded inside an external website
#
# Logging in via an iframe is a complicated affair.
#
# The flow is:
#
#  An initial iframe is requested at /auth/iframe.
#  This iframe loads up the easyXDM JS library (http://easyxdm.net/wp/) and
#  establishes an RPC socket and stores the reference into the window scope.
#
#  The first hurdle is that XDM requires that the url of the iframe not change
#  Therefore it's not possible to prerform a normal login inside the iframe.
#
#  To get around this restriction a second iframe is nested inside the parent (xdm'ed) iframe.
#  The child iframe can:
#    * Navigate to different urls, allowing it to perform a login process
#    * It can also communicate back to the parent via the DOM window.parent object, and from there
#      access the RPC socket at window.parent.socket
#
#  An additional hurdle is that third party identity services disallow loading inside an iframe
#  by using the X-Frame-Options http header.
#
#  To overcome this restriction clicks on the third-party login links are intercepted and:
#    * A pop-up window is opened with the initial url of /auth/omniauth_start_popup
#    * The method associated with that url flags the session and issues a redirect to the appropriate service
#    * Once the omniauth flow is complete, the popup notifies the iframe is notified using the DOM window.opener
