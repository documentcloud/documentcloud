# How to Add Accounts

Manage your organization's DocumentCloud accounts by clicking the "[Manage Accounts][]" link at the bottom of the sidebar to open a list of every account in your organization.

DocumentCloud supports three categories of users in any organization: **administrators**, **contributors**, and **freelancers**.

 * **Administrators** can create new DocumentCloud accounts and disable old ones. Assign administrative privileges to as many users as appropriate. 

 * **Contributors** can upload, annotate, and edit documents, and can access documents shared across the newsroom.
  
 * **Freelancers** can upload, annotate, and edit their own documents and any documents that have been explicitly shared with them. Freelancers do not have access to the rest of your newsroom's documents.
  
Edit names, change the email address you use to log in and update your password in the account dialog as well. Our avatar graphics come from [Gravatar][]. Create an account there if you like, but your avatar doesn't appear outside of the workspace.

You may also wish to learn more about reviewers and other [collaboration][] tools or read up on DocumentCloud [privacy][].
