# Collaboration

You already know you can <a href="/help/privacy#access">share documents with everyone in your newsroom</a>. You can also share projects full of documents with other users, whether or not they're in your newsroom, and share specific documents with reviewers, whether or not they have a DocumentCloud account.

##  <span id="collaborate">Sharing Projects with Reporters</span>

Collaboration in DocumentCloud is based around sharing projects or sharing specific documents. Sharing a project with another user gives them access to view and edit all of the documents in that project and all the public notes on those documents. Your private notes will still be private. 

To start sharing, you'll need to know the email address that each collaborator uses to log in to DocumentCloud. Click any project's edit icon <span class="icon edit_glyph" style="padding-left:16px;position:relative;top: -2px;">&#65279;</span> ... or choose **Share this Project** from the **Analyze** menu. The project's edit pane will appear, where you can click on "Add a collaborator to this project", and enter the email address of your collaborator's DocumentCloud account.

Shared projects will appear in each collaborator's sidebar and they will be able to view, edit, and annotate all documents in the project. They'll also be able to add new documents to the project, which will in turn be available to you.

## <span id="reviewer">Sharing Documents with Reviewers</span>

You can share specific documents for review with anyone with an email address &mdash; no DocumentCloud account required. This is useful for crowdsourcing your document annotations among experts, or quickly sharing a document on deadline.

To get started, select the documents you wish to share, and choose **Share these Documents** from the **Analyze** menu. Enter the email address of the person you wish to invite to review the documents. If they don't have a DocumentCloud account, you'll be prompted to enter their name.

DocumentCloud will email each reviewer a unique URL for them to access their shared documents. They can follow the links and add annotations to the documents, which you may later edit and publish as you see fit. Before the reviewer emails are sent, you'll have a chance to enter a personal message or instructions for the document reviewers.
