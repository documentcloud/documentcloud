# API Guidelines and Terms of Service

A limited portion of DocumentCloud's API is available for public use, including document search and individual document data retrieval. All other resources require authentication via a DocumentCloud account. No API key is required.

Please be considerate and don't hammer our servers. Also:

* You may not recreate DocumentCloud.org in its entirety or build an application that simply displays the complete set of documents. You may not build an application that displays the document set of a contributing organization.

* If your project allows users to interact with data from DocumentCloud, you must cite DocumentCloud as the source of your data. If your project allows users to view or browse specific documents, you must cite DocumentCloud and the contributing organizations as identified in the API.

* You may not use the API commercially; you may not charge people money to look at the data or sell advertising specifically against it.

* You understand and acknowledge that any data provided by our API may contain errors and omissions.

_Restrictions on the use of the DocumentCloud API do not apply to participating organizations working with documents uploaded by their own users. We reserve the right to revise these guidelines. If you violate the spirit of these terms, especially if you use the API to systematically access and reprint documents that you or your newsroom didn't contribute, expect to be blocked without advance warning._

# Document Methods

<a name="search-documents"></a>
## GET /api/search.json

Search the catalog of public documents. This method can be used to scrape the public documents from your account for embedding purposes or to enable searches of your archive of uploaded documents directly from your own website. See our <a href="searching">search documentation</a> for help with search queries.

Parameter     | Description           |  Example
--------------|-----------------------|--------------
q             | the search query      | group:nytimes title:nuclear
page          | response page number  | 3 (defaults to 1)
per_page      | the number of documents to return per page | 100 (defaults to 10, max is 1,000)
sections      | include document sections in the results | true (not present by default)
annotations   | include document annotations in the results | true (not present by default)
data          | include key/value data in the results | true (not present by default)
mentions      | include highlighted mentions of the search phrase | 3 (not present by default, max is 10)
order         | the order by which documents are listed | title (default is "created\_at", other choices are: "score", "created\_at", "title", "page_count", "source")

### Example

    /api/search.json?q=obama&page=2

<div class="api_search_form">
  <p>
    Use the search form below to try queries and see what the resulting JSON looks like.
  </p>
  <div>
    <form id="search_form" action="about:blank" autocomplete="off">
      <div id="run_search" class="minibutton default">Search</div>
      <div class="text_input">
        <div class="background">
          <div class="inner">
            <input type="text" name="q" id="q" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <label for="q">
        Search Query:
        <div>ex: "title:arrest"</div>
      </label>
    </form>
  </div>

  <pre id="search_results" style="display: none;"></pre>
</div>

### Tips

 * If you'd like to get back search results with more than 10 documents on a page, pass the `per_page` parameter. A maximum of 1,000 documents will be returned at a time.

<a name="upload-documents"></a>
## POST /api/upload.json

Our API for bulk uploads exposes the same method that we use internally, but wraps it in basic authentication over HTTPS. Documents will be uploaded into the authenticated account.

You can either upload a local file using a standard multi-part upload, or tell DocumentCloud to download the file from a public server by passing a URL.

Parameter     | Description           |  Example
--------------|-----------------------|--------------
file            | (required) either the contents of a local file, or the URL where the document can be found | --
title           | (required) the document's canonical title | 2008 Blagojevich Tax Return
source          | (optional) the source who produced the document | U.S. Attorney's Office
description     | (optional) a paragraph of detailed description | This prosecution exhibit is the 2008 joint tax return for Rod and Patti Blagojevich. It shows their total income for the year was $284,000.
language        | (optional) The language of the document.  Will be used to determine what OCR package to use for files that require OCR processing. Default is: "eng" | eng
related_article | (optional) the URL of the article associated with the document | http://example.com/news/blago/2010-5-3.html
published_url   | (optional) the URL of the page on which the document will be embedded | http://documents.example.com/blago-transcript.html
access          | (optional) one of "public", "private", "organization", defaults to "private" | public
project         | (optional) a numeric Project id, to upload the document into an existing project | 1012
data            | (optional) a hash of arbitrary key/value data pairs | {"data": {"status": "active"}} (json) <br /> data[status]=active (query string)
secure          | (optional) If you're dealing with a truly sensitive document, pass the "secure" parameter in order to prevent the document from being sent to OpenCalais for entity extraction. | true
force_ocr | (optional) specify that a document should be OCR'd even if it has text in it (default is "false") | true

### Tips

 * Please ensure that you send the request properly encoded as "multipart/form-data"
 * Review your uploaded files and add a source and description if you didn't.

### Example

Using Ruby's RestClient library you could do:

    RestClient.post('https://ME%40TEST.COM:SECRET@www.documentcloud.org/api/upload.json',
      :file   => File.new('/full/path/to/document/document.pdf','rb'),
      :title  => "2008 Blagojevich Tax Return",
      :source => "U.S. Attorney's Office",
      :access => 'private',
      :data   => {"date" => "2009-04-01", "exhibit" => "E1146"}
    )

<a name="get-document"></a>
## GET /api/documents/[id].json

Retrieve the canonical JSON representation of a particular document, as specified by the document id (usually something like: **1659580-economic-analysis-of-the-south-pole-traverse**).

### Example Response

    {"document":{
      "id":"1659580-economic-analysis-of-the-south-pole-traverse",
      "title":"Economic Analysis of the South Pole Traverse",
      "access":"public"

    }}

### Tips

 * **Security note:** For fidelity with the source document, the extracted text (available via the URLs provided in `document.resources.text` and the `document.resources.page.text` page iteration pattern) is not sanitized. **You should always escape document and page text before insertion into the DOM.**

<a name="update-document"></a>
## PUT /api/documents/[id].json

Update a document's **title**, **source**, **description**, **related article**, **access level**, or **data** with this method. Reference your document by its id (usually something like: **1659580-economic-analysis-of-the-south-pole-traverse**).

Parameter     | Description           |  Example
--------------|-----------------------|--------------
title | (optional) the document's canonical title | 2008 Blagojevich Tax Return
source | (optional) the source who produced the document | U.S. Attorney's Office
description | (optional) a paragraph of detailed description | This prosecution exhibit is the 2008 joint tax return for Rod and Patti Blagojevich. It shows their total income for the year was $284,000.
related_article | (optional) the URL of the article associated with the document | http://example.com/news/blago/2010-5-3.html
published_url | (optional) the URL of the page on which the document will be embedded | http://documents.example.com/blago-transcript.html
access | (optional) one of "public", "private", "organization" | "public"
data | (optional) a hash of arbitrary key/value data pairs | {"data": {"status": "active"}} (json) <br /> data[status]=active (query string)

The response value of this method will be the JSON representation of your document (as seen in the GET method above), with all updates applied.

### Tips

 * If your HTTP client is unable to create a PUT request, you can send it as a POST and add an extra parameter: `_method=put`

<a name="delete-document"></a>
## DELETE /api/documents/[id].json

Delete a document from DocumentCloud. You must be authenticated as the owner of the document for this method to work.

### Tips

 * If your HTTP client is unable to create a DELETE request, you can send it as a POST, and add an extra parameter: `_method=delete`

<a name="get-entities"></a>
## GET /api/documents/[id]/entities.json

Retrieve the JSON for all of the entities that a particular document contains, specified by the document id (usually something like: **1659580-economic-analysis-of-the-south-pole-traverse**). Entities are ordered by their relevance to the document as determined by OpenCalais.

### Example Response

    {
      "entities":{
        "person":[
          { "value":"Ramadan Aff", "relevance":0.72 },
          { "value":"Sarah Normand", "relevance":0.612 },
          ...
