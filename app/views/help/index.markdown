# Welcome to DocumentCloud

DocumentCloud is an online platform for uploading, analyzing, annotating and publishing documents. If you're just looking to get started, try our [guided tour][], or take a look at [what other reporters are doing with DocumentCloud][].

If you've uploaded documents to the index, here's what you can do with them:

## Finding Your Way Around the Workspace

If you're looking at a list of documents (search results, your documents, a single project) you can click on a thumbnail image to select that document. It works the same way as icons on your desktop: you can use the shift or control (command) keys, or drag across to select multiple documents at once. With documents selected, you can use the toolbar to edit titles and descriptions, change privacy settings, add documents to new projects or plot them on a timeline.

Double-click a document's title or icon to launch a viewer, where you can edit and annotate the document, if you have access to it. Anyone with a DocumentCloud account can use the viewer to place a private note on any document.

Right-click on a document to open a context menu, showing a list of actions that can be done to the document.
