    </h6>
    <p>When investigative reporter Phil Williams looked into the case of a judge putting mentally ill defendants in the care of an unlicensed psychiatrist, he accompanied his report an extensively cross referenced set of documents. News Channel 5 used DocumentCloud to point readers from <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/category/206230/mhc#document/p4/a10633">a letter</a> sent to the station's legal counsel insisting that the subject of their investigation had never actually collected on checks made out to "Casey  Psychological Services" to <a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/category/206237/mhc-checks-to-casey-psychological-services#document/p1/a10724">cashed checks</a> suggesting otherwise and from those checks to the  <a href="http://michie.lexisnexis.com/tennessee/lpext.dll/tncode/26396/26d01/26d1d/26d4c?fn=document-frame.htm&f=templates&2.0#">Tennessee law</a> that appears to have been violated by the unlicensed counselor.

  <p>In 1970 Ruben Salazar was killed by police while covering an anti-war protest in East Los Angeles. A case rife with controversy, questions, and suspicions, his death became a rallying point in the Mexican American civil rights movement. 40 years later, after <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/09/local/la-me-salazar-20100810">refusing a public records request</a> for documents that might shed some light on the circumstances of his death, Los Angeles County's Sheriff's Department <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/19/local/la-me-0818-salazar-20100819">agreed</a> to turn the files over to the Office of Independent Review. While <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporters waited for the report, they assembled their own <a href="http://documents.latimes.com/ruben-salazar/">folio</a> of early clippings on Ruben Salazar.

  </h6>
  <p> Following a February 2010 report on flight outsourcing at major airlines, Frontline viewers encouraged the show to take a look at the outsourcing of airline maintenance work. The resulting piece found an unregulated and tight margined maintenance industry. Reporters from Investigative Reporting Workshop and Frontline also found it quite difficult to access information about the airline maintenance industry and federal regulation of it, but what documents they were able to acquire were published right alongside their reporting. Producers at <a href="http://investigativereportingworkshop.org">Investigative Reporting Workshop</a> used <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/help/api">DocumentCloud's API</a> to pull thumbnail images, document titles and short descriptions of each document and automatically assemble an inviting overview of the source material behind their report.

  <p>Reporter Tracy Loew used DocumentCloud to organize and annotate hundreds of documents that she accumulated in the course of her 16-month investigation of questionable spending in Willamette, Oregon's regional school district. Her reporting turned up a decade's worth of red flags that had been raised -- and ignored -- in the agency's financial management, adding up to millions of misspent dollars.  <i>Statesman Journal</i> used DocumentCloud to publish the contracts, court filings, and correspondance underpinning Loew's findings. The board charged with overseeing the department claimed to be ignorant of the shenanigans, but the paper's documents suggest that the board was part of the problem.

  <p>
    <i>ProPublica</i>, NPR's <i>Planet Money</i> and <i>This American Life</i>
    collaborated on an extensive report on one hedge fund's unorthodox and legally
    questionable practices. The subject of their reporting declined to respond to
    most questions put to them by reporters, who in turn used DocumentCloud
    annotations to highlight Magnetar's responses. They also provided readers
    with email messages discussed in the reporting. <br />
