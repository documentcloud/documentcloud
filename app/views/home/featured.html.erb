    <small><i>USA Today</i>, April 19, 2012</small>
  <p>USA Today invites readers to explore <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/smelting-lead-contamination/">a vast multimedia project</a> that documents former lead factory sites across the country. The project shares government documents for many of the factory sites, which showcase a failure to correct contamination or even warn people of it. Like in their <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-03-13/dangerous-sexual-predators-detained/53621210/1">“136 Men” project</a>, USA Today includes pop-up windows that zoom in on just a few important lines in the documents.

  <p>Source documents often serve as clues for investigative reporters. Sometimes, they serve as clues for readers. <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/">The New York Times’ health blog</a> recently challenged its readers to determine the correct diagnosis for a woman’s mysterious illness. The blog offered information like doctors’ notes and MRI results <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/think-like-a-doctor-a-crooked-walk/">in a series of small, embedded document viewers</a>. Getting to see “the same information as the doctors who originally encountered this medical mystery” helped the blog readers solve the mystery within a day.

  <p>At a hush-hush surveillance conference outside Washington, D.C., last October, the Wall Street Journal obtained hundreds of documents that marketed off-she-shelf surveillance technologies. In true journalism fashion, they put them all up online. The documents, categorized into Hacking, Intercept, Data Analysis, Web Scraping and Anonymity, are evidence of a burgeoning retail market for hidden surveillance tools.
