<%= @account.full_name %> --

Someone (probably you) asked to reset your sourceAFRICA password. You can use the link below to do just that:

<%= DC.server_root(:force_ssl => true) %>/accounts/enable/<%= @key %>

Enjoy,

PS. If you need help using sourceAFRICA, take a look at our documentation (http://sourceafrica.org/help) or write to support@codeforafrica.org.
