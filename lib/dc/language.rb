    # For user facing purposes, documents are considered to have only a language.
    # In reality documents possess two distinct properties a language
    # and a written script. The former can be represented by ISO-639-2
    # language codes and the latter by ISO-15924 script codes.
    #
    # In almost all cases the script of a document can be inferred based
    # on its language (Ukrainian language documents are all written using Cyrillic)
    # with the exception of Chinese which for political and historical reasons
    # possesses two written scripts, traditional and simplified.
    #
    # The Tesseract OCR system requires knowing both language and script in order
    # to be able to correctly process documents, and consequently has two separate
    # langauge packages for Chinese, 'chi-tra' and 'chi-sim'.  All other language
    # packs are identical to their ISO-639-2 code.
