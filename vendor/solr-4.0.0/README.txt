Solr example
------------

This directory contains an instance of the Jetty Servlet container setup to 
run Solr using an example configuration.

To run this example:

  java -jar start.jar

in this example directory, and when Solr is started connect to 

  http://localhost:8983/solr/

To add documents to the index, use the post.jar (or post.sh script) in
the example/exampledocs subdirectory (while Solr is running), for example:

     cd exampledocs
     java -jar post.jar *.xml
Or:  sh post.sh *.xml

For more information about this example please read...

Notes About These Examples
--------------------------

* SolrHome *

By default, start.jar starts Solr in Jetty using the default Solr Home
directory of "./solr/" (relative to the working directory of hte servlet 
container).  To run other example configurations, you can specify the 
solr.solr.home system property when starting jetty...

  java -Dsolr.solr.home=multicore -jar start.jar
  java -Dsolr.solr.home=example-DIH/solr -jar start.jar

* References to Jar Files Outside This Directory *

Various example SolrHome dirs contained in this directory may use "<lib>"
statements in the solrconfig.xml file to reference plugin jars outside of 
this directory for loading "contrib" plugins via relative paths.  

If you make a copy of this example server and wish to use the 
ExtractingRequestHandler (SolrCell), DataImportHandler (DIH), UIMA, the 
clustering component, or any other modules in "contrib", you will need to 
copy the required jars or update the paths to those jars in your 
solrconfig.xml.

* Logging *

By default, Jetty & Solr will log to the console. This can be convenient when 
first getting started, but eventually you will want to log to a file. To 
configure logging, you can just pass a system property to Jetty on startup:

  java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=etc/logging.properties -jar start.jar
 
This will use Java Util Logging to log to a file based on the config in
etc/logging.properties. Logs will be written in the logs directory. It is
also possible to setup log4j or other popular logging frameworks.
